Tchaikovsky - Violin Concerto in D major
Performed By
DIOSPYROS
Joint Performance By
Anna Hannah
The Violin Concerto in D was written in 1878 during the time almost immediately after Tchaikovsky 
fled from his failed marriage. The concerto was created after Tchaikovsky met with his old friend, 
Joseph Kotek, in Switzerland. Together they played Lalo’s Symphony Espagnole which gave Tchaikovsky 
the inspiration. Now performed by DIOSPYROS, we can recollect the work of a great music master.
